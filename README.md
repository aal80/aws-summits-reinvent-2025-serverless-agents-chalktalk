# Building Production-Ready Agentic AI architectures with AWS Serverless

Agentic AI is transforming enterprise applications, but taking it from prototype to production requires more than just prompting. Join this chalk talk to discuss pragmatic, scalable patterns for building agentic AI systems using AWS Serverless services like Lambda, ECS Fargate, and API Gateway. You'll learn how to architect and operate distributed agent-based systems, including patterns for running Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Together, we’ll walk through end-to-end architecture using the Strands Agents SDK, covering best practices for security, observability, and governance. Bring your questions — and leave with concrete patterns you can apply in your organization right away.
